# PYTHON COURSE

In the Python course I used the book Python Crash Course, 3rd edition, by Eric Matthes.

During the course I passed the following:

1. Introduction (setting up the programming environment)
2. Variables and simple data types (string, numbers (integer, float), comments)
3. Introducing lists ['...','...']
   (changing, adding and removing elements - APPEND, INSERT, DEL, POP)
   (sorting a list - SORT, SORTED, REVERSE, LEN)
4. Working with lists
   (for loop, range, slicing a list, copying a list, tuple)
5. IF statements
6. Dictionaries (maps) {}
   (key - value pairs)
7. User input and while loops
   (input(), flag, brake, continue, while loop)
8. Functions
9. Classes
10. Files and exceptions
    (reading and writing)
11. Testing code

Along with the Python course, I read about algorithms and data structures. 
Specifically, "Grokking algorithms" by Aditya Y. Bhargava.

At the end of the course, I did two assignments in Python, 
reminder and dictionary, through which I renewed the basics of Python.
